# Intro
recursive_minifier is package that will minify(uglify, compress) all js (including es6+) and css
## Installation
```
npm install recursive_minifier
```
## Usage
```
node minify.js "path/to/minify"
```
It is that simple. Eventually if you install like most users would do it would look like this instead:
```
node ./node_modules/recursive_minifier/minify.js "path/to/minify"
```
### Maintenance
Most probably I will not answet to issues, though if I spot an issue I will fix everything what is needed.
